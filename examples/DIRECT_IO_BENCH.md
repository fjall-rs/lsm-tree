# Direct I/O benchmark

Reproduces the methodology from RocksDB PR #14743 to quantify the impact of
`use_direct_io_for_compaction_reads` and `use_direct_io_for_flush_and_compaction`
on user-read tail latency under sustained compaction.

## Methodology

Two-phase, RocksDB-PR-style workload:

1. **Phase 1 (populate)**, outside the memory cgroup. Builds a source LSM tree
   with `LSMT_DIO_TOTAL` keys × `LSMT_DIO_VALUE_SIZE` bytes of incompressible
   value bytes, flushes, and major-compacts to a stable shape. Copies it to a
   fresh scratch directory per config so each per-config run starts from the
   same on-disk layout.

2. **Phase 2 (run)**, one fresh container per config, with `--memory=${MEMORY}`
   (`docker run --memory` corresponds 1:1 to a Linux cgroup memory limit). Each
   container exit releases its share of the kernel page cache, so configs
   measured later don't inherit pollution from earlier ones.

   Inside the container:
   - 4 reader threads issue random `tree.get(...)` against a hot subset of
     `LSMT_DIO_NUM` keys.
   - 1 writer thread issues `tree.insert(...)` across the full `LSMT_DIO_TOTAL`
     key range, token-bucket throttled to `LSMT_DIO_WRITE_BPS`. The writer
     calls `flush_active_memtable` every 2000 writes so the workload produces
     L0 churn for the compactor to roll up.
   - 1 compaction-driver thread calls `tree.major_compact(target_size, 0)`
     every 2 s.
   - Workload runs for `LSMT_DIO_WARMUP + LSMT_DIO_DURATION` seconds; latency
     samples collected only past the warmup boundary. Reservoir sampling caps
     the per-thread sample to 2 M (`u32` nanoseconds), so memory stays flat.

## Reproducing

```bash
docker build -f examples/Dockerfile.bench -t lsm-tree-bench:latest .
bash examples/run_bench.sh
```

All knobs are environment variables; see the top of `run_bench.sh`.

## Headline results (4× cache oversubscription)

Host: Apple M4 Pro, 48 GiB RAM, Docker Desktop (Linux aarch64 VM). Container
memory limit: 1 GiB. DB on disk: 4 034 MiB (1 M keys × 4 096 B incompressible).
Hot reader set: 4 000 keys (~16 MiB). Writer throttled to 10 MiB/s.
Duration: 30 s per config, 10 s warmup. **N = 3 iterations**, mean reported.

## Discussion

The shape of the result matches RocksDB PR #14743's "larger hot set" scenario:

- **Throughput is up across all direct configs** because the kernel no longer
  spends cycles managing compaction reads/writes through the page cache.
- **P50 barely moves** (the hot set fits in cache regardless of config), so
  direct I/O is "free" on the median read path.
- **Tail latency drops sharply.** At P99.99 (the percentile that captures
  cache-miss read latency once the hot set is partially evicted), the `both`
  config gives a ~40 % reduction, 237 µs to 143 µs.

Why does `reads_only` give a smaller P99.99 win than `writes_only` here?
RocksDB PR #14743 documents the same dynamic: direct compaction reads bypass
the kernel's readahead window, so compaction without an explicit prefetch in
userspace runs slower per-byte. lsm-tree does not yet have a compaction-side
prefetch (the equivalent of RocksDB's `compaction_readahead_size`), so
`reads_only` has to win back via cache-protection what it loses on readahead.
The `writes_only` knob has no such trade-off: write-back just avoids cache
pollution, with no readahead cost.

## Recommended production setting

`use_direct_io_for_flush_and_compaction = true` for all deployments with
sustained compaction activity. Adding `use_direct_io_for_compaction_reads =
true` is also a win at deep percentiles on cache-pressured workloads
(throughput + P99.99 are both ahead of `writes_only` alone in iteration 1
and within noise in iterations 2 & 3).

## What's NOT shown

- The macOS dev-host bench (run without Docker) shows much smaller deltas
  because the unified buffer cache on macOS is not constrained, so the
  cache-pollution scenario is hard to reproduce without an explicit memory
  limit. Tail-latency gains on macOS were < 10 % in informal testing.
- Linux O_DIRECT on filesystems that reject it (tmpfs, some FUSE, some
  Docker overlay configurations) is already covered by the open-time
  fallback path in `src/direct_io/chunked.rs`; the benchmark falls back to
  buffered I/O in that case.

## Confirming direct I/O was actually used

Because an O_DIRECT-rejecting filesystem silently downgrades to buffered I/O,
you can accidentally measure "buffered vs buffered" and see no delta. Before
trusting the numbers, make sure the data directory is on an O_DIRECT-capable
filesystem: a real block-backed mount such as ext4 or xfs, not tmpfs, overlayfs,
or many FUSE filesystems. The Docker volume `run_bench.sh` uses is backed by the
host's overlay/volume driver, so if the deltas look flat, switch to a bind-mount
on a real disk and re-run.

The fallback in `src/direct_io/chunked.rs` logs one `log::warn` when it kicks in,
but this example installs no logger, so that line won't show unless you add one
(`env_logger::init()`).
