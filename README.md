A K.I.S.S. implementation of log-structured merge trees (LSM-trees/LSMTs) in Rust.

> [!NOTE]
> This crate only provides a primitive LSM-tree, not a full storage engine.
> For example, it does not ship with a write-ahead log.
> You probably want to use https://github.com/fjall-rs/fjall instead.

## About

This is the most feature-rich LSM-tree implementation in Rust! It features:

- Thread-safe `BTreeMap`-like API
- Mostly [safe](./UNSAFE.md) & 100% stable Rust
- Block-based tables with compression support & prefix truncation
  - Optional block hash indexes in blocks for faster point lookups [[3]](#footnotes)
  - Per-level filter/index block pinning configuration
- Range & prefix searching with forward and reverse iteration
- Block caching to keep hot data in memory
- *AMQ* filters (currently Bloom filters) to improve point lookup performance
- Snapshots (*MVCC*)
- Optionally partitioned block index & filters for better cache efficiency [[1]](#footnotes)
- Size-tiered, (concurrent) Leveled and FIFO compaction 
- Multi-threaded flushing (immutable/sealed memtables)
- Key-value separation (optional) [[2]](#footnotes)
- Single deletion tombstones ("weak" deletion)

Keys are limited to 65536 bytes, values are limited to 2^32 bytes.
As is normal with any kind of storage engine, larger keys and values have a bigger performance impact.

## Feature flags

### lz4

Allows using `LZ4` compression, powered by [`lz4_flex`](https://github.com/PSeitz/lz4_flex).

*Disabled by default.*

### bytes

Uses [`bytes`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/bytes) as the underlying `Slice` type.

*Disabled by default.*

## Stable disk format

The disk format is stable as of 1.0.0.

2.0.0 uses a new disk format and needs a manual format migration.

Future breaking changes will result in a major version bump and a migration path.

## Run unit benchmarks

```bash
cargo bench --features lz4
